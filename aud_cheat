To demonstrate how the various settings affect the appearance of an audio
track in spectrogram view, start with an artificially constructed test
track. It should consist of 10 segments of a sine wave tone at 2000 Hz,
each 2 seconds long. The level of each segment in dB should be indicated
by labels below the audio track.

Observe how the track appears in waveform dB view.
Observe how the track appears in spectrogram view,
using the default settings:

    Window size: 1024
    Window type: Hanning
    Zero padding factor: 1
    Minimum frequency (Hz): 0
    Maximum frequency (Hz): 8000
    Gain (dB): 20
    Range (dB): 80
    Frequency Gain (dB/dec): 0.

Gain can be said to increase the "brightness". Ex: With the setting of 20
dB, any frequency(Hz) band that had (before gain amplification) a level of
-20 dB or greater (and now, after amplification has a level greater than 0
dB) will be displayed as white. Similarly the "lower" level bands will also
"get brighter".

There are six color bands in spectrogram view: white, red, magenta, dark
blue, light blue and gray. The Range setting determines the spacing between
colors.

With the default settings of Gain = 20 dB and Range = 80 dB, the colors
correspond to the following levels:

  any above -20 dB:
    indistinguishably white
  from -40 dB to -20 dB:
    transition from red to white
  from -60 dB to -40 dB:
    transition from magenta to red
  from -80 dB to -60 dB:
    transition from dark blue to magenta
  from -100dB to -80 dB:
    transition from light blue to dark blue
  any below -100dB:
    transition from gray to light blue

decibel() {

The decibel(dB) is a unit of measurement to express the ratio of one value
of a power or field quantity to another on a logarithmic scale, the
logarithmic quantity being called the power level or field level,
respectively.

Depending on the nature of the quantities, differing scales may express
a ratio in decibels:

  power
  field(root-power)

To express a power ratio:

  The number of decibels is 10 times its logarithm to base 10. For example:
    A change in power by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10 dB change in level.

To express field(root-power) quantities:

  The number of decibels is 20 times its logarithm to base 10. For example:
    A change in amplitude by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20 dB change in level.

This difference in scale by factor of two allows the related power and field
levels to change by the same number of decibels.

In linear systems, these definitions allow the distinction between
root-power quantities and power quantities to be ignored when specifying
changes as levels:

  An amp can be said to have a "3 dB" gain w/o specifying whether voltage
  or power are being compared; for a given linear load  (e.g. an 8 Î©
  speaker), such an increase will result in a 3 dB increase in both the
  sound pressure level and the sound power level at a given location near
  the speaker.
